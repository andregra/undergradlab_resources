This folder contains some coding resources for my Undergrad Econ Research Lab, where undergraduates can get some experience working with data. 
The folder "cps_housing" contains material about my project using CPS and housing data to study the relationship of demographic changes and housing prices. We look in particular at household formation, and immigration.
